When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository provides three functions.
    1. It acts as a backup to your code recording all the commits that you
    have stored locally.
    2. It allows for a project to be shared so others may take that code
    and add there own changes without effecting your code.
    3. It allows for a project to be worked on by a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may have unfinished sections of code that your not ready to sync.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A Fork is a clone of a repository where both the original and the clone
    reside on Github servers and was created using the Fork tool.

    A clone is a copy of a repository where one copy is on a remote server
    and one copy is local or both copies of the repository are local.

    A branch is part of a repository where changes exist apart from the Master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
